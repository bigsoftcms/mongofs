### Requirements:
Tested Operating Systems: Centos 7 

Tested MongoDB: 3.6. Should be able to run easily since 3.0. Works with sharding and replica set.

Tested Python version: 3.6.

### General information
Mount a Mongo database as a FUSE file system. Purpose of this implementation is the following:
1. Allows infinite scaling, up to Petabytes of data.
2. Avoid limitations of basic file systems by allowing the following: 
   - You can put millions of files in the same directory
   - You can create files of hundreds of TBs (being stuck Ã  4TB with some NFS storage is not nice)
   - Infinite hierarchy
   - Automatic redundancy 
   - Automatic compression
   - Easier setup than HDFS (and more appropriate for small files)
   - Faster creation/deletion of millions of files 
   - Super-fast listing of files, and computation of total directory size.
   - No "advanced" problems that you could find with inodes, ... once you start to have millions of files.

### Developer's guide

1. First installation

We assume that you already have a MongoDB installation, otherwise, follow the procedure described here: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/
```
git clone git@github.com:gilles-degols/mongofs.git
yum -y install https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
yum -y install python36u fuse fuse-libs
python3.6 -m ensurepip --default-pip
python3.6 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3.6 -m pip remove fuse # Otherwise conflicts can happen with fusepy
python3.6 -m pip install  -r requirements.txt
```
2. Mount the file system in a temporary directory

For now, it will expect a local MongoDB instance running on 127.0.0.1. A configuration file will be possible later on.
```
mkdir -p /mnt/mongofs
python3.6 src/main.py /mnt/data
```
